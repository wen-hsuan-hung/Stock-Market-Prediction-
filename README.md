# Stock-Market-Prediction

In this stock market prediction project, I worked with teammates to predict the rise and fall of the stock market. We tokenized the news on Taiwanese forum and news websites, ranked the importance of the words based on TF-IDF algorithm, and combined the information with stock market data, to build up a random forest classifier to predict whether the stock price would “rise”, “fall”, or “remain stable”.
